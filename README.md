# Hunted — Static Web App

Features:
- **Host spinner** to choose the Hunter.
- **Players** get a slot-machine interval (0:00–2:00) and a repeating **countdown** that **beeps** at 0 (final 10 seconds turn red).
- **Quick Rules** modal from the home screen.
- **Keep screen awake** toggle (Wake Lock API; shows status + re-acquires on return to the page).
- Dark/Light theme toggle.

If Wake Lock isn’t supported (some iPhones), the app will show guidance; you can also set Auto-Lock to “Never” in iOS Settings during play.
