# How to Play Hunted

## 1. Setup
- Use at least four players in a confined area (for example, a house or similar indoor space).
- Each player uses their own smartphone with the Hunted site open.
- Set the phone volume to maximum and disable silent or “do not disturb” modes.

## 2. Choosing the Hunter
- One player opens the site and selects **Host New Game** on their phone.
- All players gather around this phone.
- The host presses **Spin**. When the arrow stops, the player it points to is the Hunter for this game.

## 3. Prey Setup
- Every player who is not the Hunter opens the site and selects **Join Game** on their own phone.
- Each Prey presses **Spin** once to receive a random timer interval between `0:00` and `2:00` minutes.
- This interval is fixed for that player until a new game is hosted.

## 4. The Hunt
- The Hunter is blindfolded and counts to 30 while the Prey hide.
- Once hidden, each Prey presses **Start** to begin their own timer.
- When a timer reaches zero, the phone plays a beep and the countdown automatically restarts with that player’s interval.
- During the final 10 seconds before each beep, the screen shows a red warning.
- Prey must remain hidden and may only move at a walking pace.
- A player is out if:
  - they are caught by the Hunter, or
  - they deliberately touch the Hunter, or
  - they run, or
  - they speak.

## 5. Ending the Game
- The game continues until only one Prey remains.
- The last remaining Prey is considered the winner.
- The group may also decide to stop the game early by agreement.

## 6. Additional Behaviour (App Mechanics)
- Timers cannot be paused once started.
- The screen is kept awake while a timer is running.
- Over time, the interval between beeps gradually shortens but does not go below three seconds.
- If a game lasts long enough, the app enters a high-intensity phase where timers flash red and beeps occur more frequently.
- If a phone is locked or the page is left and then reopened, the timer advances to match the time that
